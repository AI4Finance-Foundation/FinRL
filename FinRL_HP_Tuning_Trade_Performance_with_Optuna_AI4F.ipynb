This tutorial introduces *trade-based metrics* for hyperparameter optimization of FinRL models.\n","2. As the name implies, trade-based metrics are associated with the trade activity that FinRL captures in its actions tables. In general, a trade is represented by an entry in an actions file.\n","2. Such metrics include counts of winning and losing trades, total value of wins and losses and ratio of average market value of wins to losses.\n","1. In this tutorial, we will be tuning hyperparameters for Stable baselines3 models using Optuna.\n","2. The default model hyperparameters may not be adequate for your custom portfolio or custom state-space. Reinforcement learning algorithms are sensitive to hyperparameters, hence tuning is an important step.\n","3. Hyperparamters are tuned based on an objective, which needs to be maximized or minimized. ***In this tutorial, the ratio of average winning to losing trade value is used as the objective.*** This ratio is to be ***maximized***.\n","3. This tutorial incorporates a multi-stock framework based on the 30 stocks (aka tickers) in the DOW JONES Industrial Average. Trade metrics are calculated for each ticker and then aggregated.\n","7.**IMPORTANT**: While the DOW stocks represent a portfolio, portfolio optimization techniques, such as the classic Markowitz mean-variance model, are not applied in this analysis. Other FinRL tutorials and examples demonstrate portfolio optimization. \n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"qRF-7Vp5NCjU"},"source":["#Installing FinRL\n","# Set colab status to trigger installs\n","clb = True\n","\n","print(f'Preparing for colab: {clb}')\n","pkgs = ['FinRL', 'optuna', 'Ray/rllib','plotly','ipywidgets']\n","if clb:\n","    print(f'Installing packages: {pkgs}')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Set Variables\n","## Fixed\n","tpm_hist = {}  # record tp metric values for trials\n","tp_metric = 'avgwl'  # specified trade_param_metric: ratio avg value win/loss\n","## Settable by User\n","n_trials = 5  # number of HP optimization runs\n","total_timesteps = 2000 # per HP optimization run\n","## Logging callback params\n","lc_threshold=1e-5\n","lc_patience=15\n","lc_trial_number=5"],"metadata":{"id":"iMrTjlmamP7X"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"source":["%%capture\n","if clb:\n","    # installing packages\n","    !pip install pyfolio-reloaded  #original pyfolio no longer maintained\n","    !pip install git+https://github.com/AI4Finance-LLC/FinRL-Library.git\n","    !pip install optuna\n","    !pip install -U \"ray[rllib]\"\n","    !pip install plotly\n","    !pip install ipywidgets\n","    !pip install -U kaleido   # enables saving plots to file"],"metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"id":"bSLdukRZmzHD"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"source":["#Importing the libraries\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","# matplotlib.use('Agg')\n","import datetime\n","import optuna\n","from pathlib import Path\n","from google.colab import files\n","%matplotlib inline\n","from finrl.apps import config\n","from optuna.integration import PyTorchLightningPruningCallback\n","from finrl.finrl_meta.preprocessor.yahoodownloader import YahooDownloader\n","from finrl.finrl_meta.preprocessor.preprocessors import FeatureEngineer, data_split\n","from finrl.finrl_meta.env_stock_trading.env_stocktrading import StockTradingEnv\n","from finrl.finrl_meta.env_stock_trading.env_stocktrading_np import StockTradingEnv as StockTradingEnv_numpy\n","from finrl.drl_agents.stablebaselines3.models import DRLAgent\n","from finrl.drl_agents.rllib.models import DRLAgent as DRLAgent_rllib\n","from finrl.finrl_meta.data_processor import DataProcessor\n","import joblib\n","from finrl.plot import backtest_stats, backtest_plot, get_daily_return, get_baseline\n","import ray\n","from pprint import pprint\n","import kaleido\n","\n","import sys\n","sys.path.append(\"../FinRL-Library\")\n","\n","import itertools\n","\n","import torch\n","if torch.cuda.is_available():\n","  device = torch.device(\"cuda\")\n","else:\n","  device = torch.device(\"cpu\")\n","print(f'Torch device: {device}')\n"],"metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"id":"ShYEIr-umzHE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Zipline was developed by Quantopian, which also created pyfolio.
