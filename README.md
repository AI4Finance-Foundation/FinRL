FinRL is the open source library that provides practitioners a unified framework for pipeline strategy development. **In reinforcement learning (or deep RL), an agent learns by continuously interacting with an environment, in a trial-and-error manner, making sequential decisions under uncertainty and achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation.** The open source community **AI4Finance** (to efficiently automate trading) provides educational resources to learn about deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in quantitative finance. 

**To contribute?**  Please check the call for contributions at the end of this page.

Feel free to report bugs using Github issues, join our mailing list: [AI4Finance](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/ai4finance), and discuss FinRL in the slack channel:

Roadmaps of FinRL:

**FinRL 1.0**: entry-level toturials for beginners, with a demonstrative and educational purpose.

**FinRL 2.0**: intermediate-level framework for full-stack developers and professionals.  

FinRL provides a unified machine learning framework for various markets, SOTA DRL algorithms, benchmark finance tasks (portfolio allocation, cryptocurrency trading, high-frequency trading), live trading, etc.

# Installation:

## Docker Installation

### Option 1: Use the bin

```bash
# grant access to execute scripting (read it, it's harmless)
$ sudo chmod -R 777 docker/bin

# build the container!
$ ./docker/bin/build_container.sh

# start notebook on port 8887!
$ ./docker/bin/start_notebook.sh

# proceed to party!
```

### Option 2: Do it manually

Build the container:
```bash
$ docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t finrl docker/
```

Start the container
Note: The default container run starts jupyter lab in the root directory, allowing you to run scripts, notebooks, etc.
```bash
$ docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/home -p 8888:8888 finrl
```


## Bare-metal installation (More difficult)

Clone this repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/AI4Finance-LLC/FinRL-Library.git
```

Install the unstable development version of FinRL:
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/AI4Finance-LLC/FinRL-Library.git
```


## Prerequisites
For [OpenAI Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines), you'll need system packages CMake, OpenMPI and zlib. Those can be installed as follows

#### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cmake libopenmpi-dev python3-dev zlib1g-dev libgl1-mesa-glx
```

#### Mac OS X
Installation of system packages on Mac requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). With Homebrew installed, run the following:
```bash
brew install cmake openmpi
```

#### Windows 10

To install stable-baselines on Windows, please look at the [documentation](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/install.html#prerequisites).
    
#### Create and Activate Python Virtual-Environment (Optional but highly recommended)
cd into this repository
```bash
cd FinRL-Library
```
Under folder /FinRL-Library, create a Python virtual-environment
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
Virtualenvs are essentially folders that have copies of python executable and all python packages. 

**Virtualenvs can also avoid packages conflicts.**

Create a virtualenv **venv** under folder /FinRL-Library
```bash
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```
To activate a virtualenv:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
To activate a virtualenv on windows:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
## Dependencies

The script has been tested running under **Python >= 3.6.0**, with the folowing packages installed:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Stable-Baselines3 using Pytorch

#### About [Stable-Baselines 3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3)

Stable-Baselines3 is a set of improved implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch. It is the next major version of Stable Baselines. If you have questions regarding Stable-baselines package, please refer to [Stable-baselines3 installation guide](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/install.html). Install the Stable Baselines package using pip:

```
pip install stable-baselines3[extra]

```
A migration guide from SB2 to SB3 can be found in the [documentation](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/migration.html).

#### Stable-Baselines using Tensorflow 2.0
Still [Under Development](https://github.com/Stable-Baselines-Team/stable-baselines-tf2)


### Run 
```shell
python main.py --mode=train
```
### Backtesting

Use Quantopian's [pyfolio package](https://github.com/quantopian/pyfolio) to do the backtesting.


### Data
The stock data we use is pulled from Yahoo Finance API

(The following time line is used in the paper; users can update to new time windows.)

# Contributions

- FinRL is an open source library specifically designed and implemented for quant finance. Trading environments incorporating market frictions are used and provided.
- Trading tasks accompanied by hands-on tutorials with built-in DRL agents are available in a beginner-friendly and reproducible fashion using Jupyter notebook. Customization of trading time steps is feasible.
- FinRL has good scalability, with a broad range of fine-tuned state-of-the-art DRL algorithms. Adjusting the implementations to the rapid changing stock market is well supported.
- Typical use cases are selected and used to establish a benchmark for the quantitative finance community. Standard backtesting and evaluation metrics are also provided for easy and effective performance evaluation.

## Call for Contributions

We will maintain the open source FinRL library for the "AI + finance" community and welcome you to join as contributors!

### Contributors

This project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.

## Support various markets
   We would like to support more asset markets, so that the users can test their stategies.
## SOTA DRL algorithms 
   We will continue to maintian a pool of DRL algorithms that can be treated as SOTA implementations.
## Benchmarks for typical trading tasks
   To help quants have better evaluations, here we maintain benchmarks for many trading tasks, upon which you can improve for your own tasks.
## Support live trading
   Supporting live trading can close the simulation-reality gap, it will enable quant to switch to the real market when they are confident with their strategies.
