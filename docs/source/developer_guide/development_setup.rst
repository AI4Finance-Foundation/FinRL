============================
Development setup with PyCharm
============================

This setup makes it easy to work on all of AI4Finance-Foundation's repositories simultaneously, while allowing easy debugging, committing to the respective repo's and creating PR's.

Step 1: Download Software
=======

-Download and install `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_.

-Download and install `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_.  The Community Edition (free version) offers everything you need except running Jupyter notebooks. The Full-fledged Professional Edition offers everything. A workaround to run existing notebooks in the Community edition is to copy all notebook cells into .py files.
For notebook support, you can consider PyCharm Professional Edition.

-On GitHub, fork `FinRL <https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL>`_ to your private Github repo.

-On GitHub, fork `ElegantRL <https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/ElegantRL>`_ to your private Github repo.

-On GitHub, fork `FinRL-Meta <https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL-Meta>`_ to your private Github repo.

-All next steps happen on your local machine.

Step 2: Git Clone
=======

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir ~/ai4finance
    cd ~/ai4finance
    git clone https://github.com/[your_github_username]/FinRL.git
    git clone https://github.com/[your_github_username]/ElegantRL.git
    git clone https://github.com/[your_github_username]/FinRL-Meta.git


Step 3: Create a Conda Environment
======

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/ai4finance
    conda create --name ai4finance python=3.8
    conda activate ai4finance

    cd FinRL
    pip install -r requirements.txt

ElegantRL does not contain a requirements.txt, so open ElegantRL/setup.py in a text editor and pip install anything you can find under install_requires: gym, matplotlib, numpy, pybullet, torch, opencv-python, box2d-py


Step 4: Configure a PyCharm Project
======

-Launch PyCharm

-File > Open > [ai4finance project folder]

.. image:: ../image/pycharm_status_bar.png

-At the bottom right of the status bar, change or add the interpreter to the ai4finance conda environment. Make sure when you click the "terminal" bar at the bottom left, it shows (ai4finance).

.. image:: ../image/pycharm_MarkDirectoryAsSourcesRoot.png

-At the left of the screen, in the project file tree:

    - Right-click on the FinRL folder > Mark Directory as > Sources Root
    - Right-click on the ElegantRL folder > Mark Directory as > Sources Root
    - Right-click on the FinRL-Meta folder > Mark Directory as > Sources Root

-Once you run a .py file, you will notice that you may still have some missing packages.  In that case, simply pip install them.

For example, we will revise FinRL.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/ai4finance
    cd ./FinRL
    git checkout -b branch_xxx

where branch_xxx is a new branch name. In this branch, we revised config.py. 


Step 5: Creating Commits and PRs/MRs
=======

-Create your commits as you usually do through PyCharm.

-Make sure each commit covers only 1 of the 3 repo's. Don't create a commit that spans more than two repos, e.g., FinRL and ElegantRL.

.. image:: ../image/pycharm_push_PR.png

-When you do a Git Push, PyCharm will ask you to which of the 3 repo's you want to push. Just like the above figure, we selected the repo "FinRL". 


With respect to creating a pull request (PR) or merge quest (MR), please refer to `Create a PR <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request>`_ or `Opensource Create a PR <https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github>`_.
