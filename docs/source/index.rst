   :description: FinRL is the first open source framework for financial reinforcement learning. It facilitates beginners to expose themselves to quantitative finance and to develop stock trading strategies using deep reinforcement learning. It provides fine-tuned deep reinforcement learning algorithms, including DQN, DDPG, PPO, SAC, A2C, TD3, etc.

Reinforcement learning (RL) trains an agent to solve tasks by trial and error, while DRL uses deep neural networks as function approximators. DRL balances exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge), and has been recognized as a competitive edge for automated trading. DRL framework is powerful in solving dynamic decision making problems by learning through interactions with an unknown environment, thus exhibiting two major advantages: portfolio scalability and market model independence. Automated trading is essentially making dynamic decisions, namely **to decide where to trade, at what price, and what quantity**, over a highly stochastic and complex stock market. Taking many complex financial factors into account, DRL trading agents build a multi-factor model and provide algorithmic trading strategies, which are difficult for human traders.

`FinRL`_ provides a framework that supports various markets, SOTA DRL algorithms, benchmarks of many quant finance tasks, live trading, etc.
